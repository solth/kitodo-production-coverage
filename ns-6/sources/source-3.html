&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * Interface for a service that handles access to the {@code &lt;mets:mets&gt;}
&nbsp; * element.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * METS is a schema that describes possible structures of an XML file. Despite
&nbsp; * many definitions, it is so variable that the same piece of information can be
&nbsp; * stored in various ways in the file, so that an extended technical use of the
&nbsp; * information is not readily possible. To fix this shortcoming, so-called
&nbsp; * application profiles are defined for the individual uses of METS. This
&nbsp; * interface implements a specific METS application profile, the
&nbsp; * Kitodo.Production application profile, which is closely related to the ZVDD
&nbsp; * DFG-Viewer METS Profile, which was defined by the Central Directory of
&nbsp; * Digitized Prints (ZVDD), an institution of the Lower Saxony State and
&nbsp; * University Library of the Georg-August-University Goettingen in Germany, and
&nbsp; * is widely used in Germany. Although this interface uses METS terminology, it
&nbsp; * can only be meaningfully used to read and write METS XML files that
&nbsp; * correspond to the Kitodo.Production METS application profile. For this
&nbsp; * purpose, only external functionality was made available, which is necessary
&nbsp; * for editing METS XML files in the Kitodo.Production application profile. This
&nbsp; * saves the user from the internal complexity and richness of the METS file
&nbsp; * format.
