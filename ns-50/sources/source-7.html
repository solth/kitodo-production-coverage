&nbsp; * The class Issue represents the regular appearance of one (or the) issue of a
&nbsp; * newspaper.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * Newspapers, especially bigger ones, can have several issues that may differ
&nbsp; * in time of publication (morning issue, evening issue, …), geographic
&nbsp; * distribution (Edinburgh issue, London issue, …) and/or their days of
&nbsp; * appearance (weekday issue: Mon—Fri, weekend issue: Sat, sports supplement:
&nbsp; * Mon, property market: Wed, broadcasting programme: Thu). Furthermore there
&nbsp; * may be exceptions in either that an issue didn’t appear on a date where, due
&nbsp; * to the day of week, it usually does (i.e. on holidays) or an issue may have
&nbsp; * appeared where, due to the day of week, it should not have.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * Each issue can be modeled by one Issue object each, which are held by a Block
&nbsp; * object which provides the dates of first and last appearance.
